2025-03-12 02:37:45,"Bitcoin keeps testing its support levels – and our patience. Just when we thought the worst was behind us, Trump makes a statement that sends the entire financial market into a downward spiral. And here we go again, watching our portfolios shrink with our hopes for market stability. So what's going on? Let's make sense of it all! Here is a quick rundown of the top headlines from the past 24 hours: Let's dive in! Bitcoin crashed under the $80,000 mark on Monday as markets reacted violently to growing recession fears – amplified by President Trump's eyebrow-raising weekend interview. When Fox News asked if he expects a recession this year, Trump notably refused to rule it out, mentioning a coming ""period of transition"" as the economy absorbs his new tariff policies. Bitcoin quickly dropped to $78,553 before slightly recovering, representing a shocking 14% weekly plunge amid the growing uncertainty. With crucial inflation reports coming later this week, is this just the beginning of a much deeper correction? Read the full story! Bitcoin has suddenly plunged below $81K, and the crypto market just hit ""extreme fear"" for the first time since the FTX disaster. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index crashed to 17, signaling a dramatic psychological shift that's rattling even veteran traders. Over $800 million vanished in liquidations within 24 hours. What’s causing this sudden market crash? Read the full story! The US government's aggressive push to keep the dollar dominant might accidentally become Bitcoin's unexpected ally. At the White House Crypto Summit, Treasury Secretary Bessent clarified the administration's focus: ""We are going to keep the US dollar the dominant reserve currency in the world."" This came right before Trump signed that executive order establishing a Bitcoin reserve using seized cryptocurrency from criminal cases. But how is this plan gonna become Bitcoin’s savior? Read the full story! Crypto ETPs just recorded their fourth consecutive week of outflows, with another $876 million fleeing the market. This extends a troubling trend that has now seen nearly $4.7 billion exit crypto ETPs in just one month, shrinking year-to-date inflows to a mere $2.6 billion. Bitcoin ETPs took the biggest hit, accounting for $756 million of last week's exodus. Even Short-Bitcoin ETPs saw significant outflows, suggesting investors are uncertain about the market's direction either way. Total assets under management have plummeted by $39 billion to $142 billion – the lowest point since last November. Interestingly, not all cryptocurrencies are bleeding equally. What makes Solana, XRP, and Sui the rare exceptions in this downward spiral? Read the full story! Thailand's SEC has officially welcomed USDT and USDC stablecoins into its tightly regulated ecosystem, opening new doors for everyday transactions and trading. Until now, Thailand maintained one of Asia's most restrictive approaches to crypto, allowing only Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Stellar, and a few central bank tokens. This sudden expansion hints at a major shift in government thinking. Tether quickly celebrated the announcement, highlighting how USDT can now be used as a payment rail throughout the country – potentially challenging traditional financial services. But why the sudden change of heart from one of Southeast Asia's strictest regulators? Read the full story!

2025-03-13 10:25:27,"Bitcoin's struggle to stay above $80K is starting to raise eyebrows. With Trump's tariff talk putting pressure on markets, inflation fears mounting, and global powers prepping their counter-moves, crypto isn't the only one feeling the pressure – stock markets are taking hits too. The economic chess game is getting intense, and Bitcoin's price action might just be the canary in the coal mine. So what exactly is happening in crypto today? Let's break down the top headlines: Let's dive in! Franklin Templeton just joined the list of XRP ETF applicants with a fresh S-1 filing to the SEC. Bitwise, 21Shares, Canary Capital, Grayscale, and WisdomTree are already mingling in this exclusive gathering. The proposed fund would make XRP accessible through the traditional financial system, with Coinbase handling both custody and prime broker duties. What are the chances of it getting approved? Read the full story! European Stability Mechanism's Pierre Gramegna just warned that U.S. support for dollar-backed stablecoins might be more than just crypto-friendly policy – it could be a strategic play for global financial dominance. The fear? American tech giants leveraging USD stablecoins could create a digital financial system that sidesteps European institutions entirely. Meanwhile, the ECB is scrambling to develop its digital euro, with concrete rollout plans expected by Q2. How exactly will it put the U.S. in a dominant position? Read the full story! Mt. Gox just woke up again and moved 11,501 Bitcoin worth $905 million to an unmarked wallet address. The defunct exchange has been slowly repaying creditors since July 2024. While some creditors have received payouts through Kraken and Bitstamp, Mt. Gox recently extended its repayment deadline to October 2025. The exchange still holds a staggering $2.8 billion worth of Bitcoin across its wallets. Is this move signalling another market-moving distribution? Read the full story! Ether has plummeted over 53% since December, tumbling from $4,100 heights to dangerous territory. The slide is powered by a mix of global trade war anxieties, slow development activity, and relentless selling pressure from U.S. Ether ETFs. ETFs have reported four straight weeks of outflows, with over $119 million fleeing last week alone. Analysts are now eyeing $1,800 as a critical support level, while investors worry this might break from the traditional four-year crypto cycle pattern. Is the bull cycle over for ETH? Read the full story! A massive $1.5 billion heist on Bybit has unexpectedly dragged OKX into the spotlight. According to Bloomberg, European regulators are now scrutinizing OKX's Web3 service after hackers reportedly used it to launder approximately $100 million of stolen assets. At the heart of the controversy: whether OKX's Web3 platform falls under Europe's new MiCA regulations, and what penalties might apply if it does.

2025-03-14 10:24:58,"Another day, another Bitcoin price range. Is it just us, or is the crypto market feeling incredibly boring lately? Bitcoin's been stuck in the $80K-84K zone for what feels like forever. Even that positive inflation report couldn't get BTC to break out of its price range. A quick jump to $84K had the bulls excited for approximately... nine minutes. No news is good news? Or maybe we're all just waiting for something significant to shake things up. So what’s going on? Let's make sense of it all! Here is a quick rundown of the top headlines from the past 24 hours: Let's dive in! The battle between Ripple and the SEC appears to be winding down. Sources indicate the case is ""in the process of wrapping up"" after both parties filed appeals over a $125-million judgment from last summer. Since Trump took office, the SEC has been dropping enforcement cases against crypto companies left and right. Ripple's situation is uniquely complex though. Their Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty acknowledges the additional complications of having a judgment already in place with an active appeal. But is this really about politics, or is it a sign of a fundamental regulatory shift? Read the full story! A jaw-dropping $2 billion just flowed into the world's largest crypto exchange. MGX, an Abu Dhabi investment firm, has made what might be one of the largest funding deals in crypto history – and the first institutional investment in Binance's eight-year journey.

Their 50x leveraged long for over 160,234 ETH evaporated as prices dipped below their liquidation threshold. The trader had converted all their Bitcoin holdings into this leveraged Ether bet before disaster struck. Could this massive liquidation trigger an even deeper market correction? Read the full story! The revised GENIUS stablecoin bill might not be what it seems. Jean Rausis, co-founder of Smardex, calls it a ""thinly veiled attempt to usher in central bank digital currency controls through privatized means."" The bill proposes a comprehensive framework for stablecoins like Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC, with recently added provisions for stricter requirements. Rausis believes the US government has realized controlling stablecoins means controlling financial transactions. Is this really problematic? Read the full story! Bitcoin jumped (before settling back in the same range) as the latest inflation numbers came in better than expected. The Consumer Price Index rose 2.8% in February, below economists' forecasts of 2.9%. Core inflation dropped to 3.1%, down from January's 3.3%. Bitcoin initially jumped to $84,000 after the news, rising 1% in just 10 minutes. But the celebration was short-lived – prices quickly reversed, falling back below $83,000 where they remain. This inflation cooling comes despite President Trump's fluctuating approach to tariffs, which continues to create market uncertainty.

2025-03-19 10:25:57,"Here is a 2-minute breakdown of everything important that happened in crypto today. Bitcoin's quiet takeover plan is working. While everyone's been distracted by new tokens popping up, Bitcoin's market dominance has been steadily climbing since 2023. That magical ""altseason"" we all used to count on? It might be going extinct. BTC dominance is hovering around 61.6%, and it even touched 64.3% in February. When market uncertainty hits, altcoins take the hardest fall while Bitcoin stands its ground. What's different this time? Those shiny new ETFs are siloing billions in capital that used to flow into altcoins during previous cycles. But Bitcoin's dominance isn't the only story worth tracking. The crypto landscape is shifting in some fascinating ways right now. So what's actually happening in crypto today? Let's break down the top headlines: Let's dive in! The trading giant that democratized investing just made its boldest move yet. Robinhood has launched a prediction markets hub, teaming up with Kalshi to let users bet on everything from Fed decisions to March Madness outcomes. Wall Street couldn't contain its excitement. HOOD shares jumped 8% after the announcement, a clear vote of confidence from investors who see the bigger picture. Can you bet on this platform using crypto? Read the full story! Something unprecedented is happening in the institutional crypto world. For 17 straight days – the longest streak since records began in 2015 – money has been flowing out of crypto ETFs. Last week alone saw $1.7 billion exit the market, accelerating from the previous week's outflows and pushing the five-week total to a jaw-dropping $6.4 billion. Yet somehow, amid this historic selling pressure, year-to-date numbers remain in the green. And a select few issuers are still attracting capital against all odds. Are institutions giving up on crypto? Read the full story! A forgotten giant of DeFi is suddenly back in the spotlight. PancakeSwap has leapfrogged to the #1 spot in trading volume, outpacing even Ethereum's Uniswap. Its CAKE token has soared 37% in a day. What's driving this resurgence? Two powerful catalysts have aligned. First, Binance's decision to delist Tether has sparked a massive migration to PancakeSwap, with USDT volume exploding on the platform. Second, Binance Smart Chain is experiencing a meme coin renaissance reminiscent of its 2021 glory days. BSC meme coin market cap has jumped nearly 50% in a week, creating a trading frenzy. With people losing faith in Solana, are meme coin traders switching to BSC? Read the full story! A top European Central Bank official just claimed Trump's pro-crypto policies are ""sowing the seeds"" of a potential global financial crisis. François Villeroy de Galhau argued that financial disasters ""often originate in the United States"" and suggested Trump's approach ""risks sinning through negligence."" Meanwhile, the ECB is charting its own blockchain course with a digital payments infrastructure that could eventually birth a European CBDC. The confrontation highlights a growing philosophical divide. While America races to embrace digital assets, European officials are raising red flags about systemic risks. What do other European officials think? Read the full story! Standard Chartered has dramatically slashed its ETH price target from $10,000 to $4,000, predicting continued ""structural decline"" throughout 2025. The culprit?

When prices aren't causing heart palpitations, something else always steps in to stir the pot. The last 24 hours? Perfect case in point. Solana decided it was a good day to trigger Twitter with a controversial ad, while Cathie Wood went full contrarian against the Treasury Secretary's economic takes. Just another Tuesday in crypto, right? So what exactly went down while you were busy staring at those red candles? Let's make sense of it all! Here is a quick rundown of the top headlines from the past 24 hours: Let's dive in! ARK Invest's Cathie Wood just contradicted Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the Digital Asset Summit. ""We are worried about a recession,"" she stated bluntly, pointing to a dramatic slowdown in the velocity of money. But here's the interesting part – Wood isn't panicking. In fact, she sees a hidden opportunity in the economic downturn. What hidden opportunity is she talking about? Read the full story! A Bernstein analyst just set a stunning $310 price target on Coinbase stock. That's a potential 64% jump from current levels – and it's all tied to the new administration's pivot toward crypto-friendly policies. The analyst doesn't see Coinbase as just another exchange. He described it as ""what a universal Bank would look like in the world of blockchain-based financial services."" But can regulatory frameworks actually materialize fast enough to justify such an ambitious price target? Read the full story! A Bitcoin whale just showcased elite-level trading by closing a massive short position worth over $516 million. The result? A cool $9.4 million profit in just eight days using a risky 40x leverage strategy. The investor opened at $84,043, precisely timing the market ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting. At one point, traders actually tried to ""hunt"" the whale's position by driving Bitcoin's price up – but their coordinated effort failed spectacularly. After securing profits, the whale immediately bought over 3,200 Ethereum worth $6.1 million. So this whale is bullish on ETH now? Read the full story! Bitcoin has corrected 23% from its January all-time high of $109,000, yet it's still outperforming every major global asset class. Stocks, equities, US treasuries, real estate, and precious metals – Bitcoin has beaten them all since Trump's inauguration. Despite concerns about a premature bear market, analysts at Nansen insist this is merely ""a correction within a bull market."" How sure are we that this is just a correction? Read the full story! Solana just deleted its controversial ""America is Back—Time to Accelerate"" advertisement after intense community backlash. The now-removed video had already garnered 1.4 million views, featuring patriotic themes and politically charged messaging that many found divisive. One particularly controversial line – ""I want to invent technologies, not gender"" – sparked immediate criticism across crypto Twitter. Even Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko distanced himself from the campaign, suggesting the company's previous marketing was better.

Everyone's talking about prices this, predictions that. But the real action? It's happening under the radar. While the charts might look boring, there's a whole world of intrigue playing out behind the scenes. Some of the biggest whales in crypto are making moves while nobody's watching. And let me tell you - their patterns tell a completely different story than what you're hearing. So what's actually happening while most traders are distracted? Let's make sense of it all! Here's a quick rundown of the top headlines worth your attention: Let’s dive in! Ethereum's taken a brutal 51% hit since December. But something curious is happening beneath the surface. While most traders are panicking, the biggest ETH holders are quietly accumulating. Addresses with 10k-100k ETH have been steadily buying while everyone else sells. This whale activity started picking up in early March, with a significant jump in wallets holding at least $100k worth of ETH. And there is another indicator that’s telling a bullish story. Read the full story! Bitcoin's current dip has some investors running scared, but history tells a different story.

Haun Ventures is targeting $1 billion for two new crypto investment funds, split evenly between early and late-stage opportunities. This fundraising round is positioned to be one of the largest in crypto funding since 2022. Despite aiming lower than their previous $1.5 billion raise, the firm reportedly expects these new funds to be ""oversubscribed."" What sector of crypto are they targeting that has institutional investors so eager to participate? Read the full story!

The difficulty is when you apply it to non-luxury or non-discretionary goods for which there is no domestic substitute. I can buy great wine from the US, I can't say the same for GPUs.
I think this is largely correct -- the other big loses of this are people like me who buy wine from France and GPUs from Taiwan. To put it another way: if a rich person is buying a $250,000 imported car, paying $300,000 is not a barrier to that purchase in any meaningful way.
